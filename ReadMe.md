Backpropagation for Neural Network.\\
Reference: Martin T. Hagan, et al., Neural Networks Design, Chapter 11.\\
I present a two categories classification for a 2-4-2 neural network with backpropagation algorithm, the detail of backpropagation algorithm can refer to Martin T. Hagan, et al., Neural Networks Design, Chapter 11.\\
My results can be seen in result_Backpropagation_for_neural_network.png.\\
